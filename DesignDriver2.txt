	4 parts - 
	Variables
	Input
	Processing 
	Output

Design
Variables
	(Student[]) an array of 40 Students (class objects) each containing their own student's ID and scores for the five quizzes - lab
	(Util) class variable that reads an external file and build the Student[] array - u
	(Statistics) class variable that calculate and print the lowest/highest/average scores attained by each student

Input
	(Util) the class that use the ReadFile object to read an external file that contains the SIDs and scores for all 40 students
		Util u = new Util("file.txt");


Processing
	Call the Util class to read an external file and build an array of Student objects
		lab = u.readFile(lab);
	Create the Statistics class, pass Student array, and find the statistics (low, high, avg)
		Statistics statlab = new Statistics();
		statlab.findLow(lab);
	A method that builds a StudentGrade[] array to serialize to a disk
		Each Student = One object in StudentGrade[]
		~ 15 records --> 15 files
		All StudentGrade shares the same values in Statistics

Printing
	The deserializeGrades() method will print instances of each StudentGrade object
